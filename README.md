# Simple-Search
This is a simple search and highlight program that I am working on. It uses Javascript and a bit of JQuery to work. The user types a word or phrase into a text area on the page and clicks search. The JS and JQuery then finds and highlights all matches of the users word(s)/phrases keeping case sensitivity into account. This is the beta version of  the program and only searches paragraphs, but V2 will search H1 - H6s and paragraphs. The Simple Search program in designed to be used in web browsers and has been tested so far (with success) in Chrome Windows (78.0.3904.70) and Fire Fox Desktop (70.0)
